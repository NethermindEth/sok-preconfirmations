# Overview

This repository presents a systematization of knowledge (SoK) on preconfirmations. We survey the landscape of existing approaches, categorize their underlying mechanisms, and highlight both the promises and pitfalls of this rapidly evolving space. By placing current designs within a broader taxonomy, we aim to clarify their assumptions, identify unaddressed challenges, and provide a framework for reasoning about future directions.

# Contributions
